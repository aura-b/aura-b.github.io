            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              As we look to the 21st century, we are looking towards creating new educational and networking channels for individuals to acquire the skills, knowledge, and expertise to succeed. Many tech jobs do not require an advanced degree. But communities of color and the disadvantaged cannot get hired due to a lack of basic education, mentors and trainers. Existing organizations (i.e., YearUp.org, Eleven Fifty Academy and CodeWalker Institute) are bridging this divide, but could benefit from a more scalable approach. We need to understand the existing approaches (both success and shortcomings), their connections with 21st century firms, and how these approaches do (and can) scale-up.
            </p>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Whether the business sector is med tech/biotech, internet services, manufacturing, or healthcare, innovative frameworks for 21st century job preparation must be more accessible.  These conduits must be understood, and then designed to be both effective and to be shared broadly.
<ul><li>Who (what position) stands to benefit and why?  The disadvantaged, unemployed members of society. Firms looking for qualified, local talent for entry level jobs.
</li>
<li>What is the basic need? Vocational training, connections and job placement for the disadvantaged living close to high growth areas, but unable to take advantage of those opportunities.
</li>
<li>What is the desired outcome of the solution? More jobs opportunities for the disadvantaged.
</li>
<li>What is standing in the way of a solution?  Challenges in determining what skills maximize the chances of getting an entry level tech job. Providing that training. Helping students sustain themselves while they get trained. Help with job placement. Helping firms find the trainee that best matches their requirements.
</li></ul>
</p>
<p>The problem we are trying to address is evaluating the state of open data on a local level and making that information available to the public in an accessible way.
Some of our goals are:
<ul><li>Help citizens access and/or manipulate data without coding experience.</li>
<li>Create a metric that can help cities and citizens advocate for better open data.</li></ul>
</p>

<h3>Early Sketches</h3>
<p>
  For the features, I thought it would be best to start with a profile that gets built out with the help of a bot and even an on call job specialist to chat with the applicants.

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
  I hope to continue this project within Code for Berkeley, the UC Berkeley Code for America Brigade.
