<p>Here is a collection of some of my student's work</p>
<h3>Madlibs</h3>
          <p>This project went through several iterations, the first was to teach students how to use variables, user input, and strings. </p>
          <p>Once they had practice with the concept and were excited by the story they created I taught a way to refine the project using a dictionary, for loop, and string formatting.</p>

<h3>Slot Machine using Trees</h3>
          <p>This project used the Node class to generate a random tree and then from that random tree students could choose which path down the slot machine would give them the reward they wanted.</p>
          <p>This portion was eventually incorporated into a text adventure game where the rewards would be added to a player class instance.</p>

<h3>Text Adventure Game: Art Museum Heist</h3>
          <p>This game evolved from wanting to make a text adventure game to a heist game. This covered classes and functions primarily but in each of the options of the options of the game, more topics were covered.</p>
          <p>For example in the side door / escape portion of the game, we use dictinaries and for loops to get a secret code and check for correctness.</p>
