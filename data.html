            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>As a part of a team of four we applied to UC Berkeley’s Center for Technology, Society, and Policy’s Data for Good competition sponsored by Facebook and were chosen to be one of four teams in the seed round.
Our abstract is as follows: Access to public data is vital to transparency and accountability of governments. While some cities, such as New York, have taken major strides towards this goal, there is no unified framework for evaluating openness of data at a local level. We address this problem by scoring openness of city data based on several factors, including ease of access, amount of data, recency, whether the data are up to date, etc. Using this metric, we aim to analyze and compare cities including Berkeley, Oakland, Santa Rosa, San Mateo and Palo Alto. Our project should be a tool for citizens to hold their local officials accountable and demand better practices.
</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>After meeting with the City of Berkeley’s IT Department we heard their pain points, which included:
<ul><li>Trouble allocating funding for better city data.</li>
<li>Way of tracking the data of different projects.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>The problem we are trying to address is evaluating the state of open data on a local level and making that information available to the public in an accessible way.
Some of our goals are:
<ul><li>Help citizens access and/or manipulate data without coding experience.</li>
<li>Create a metric that can help cities and citizens advocate for better open data.</li></ul>
</p>

<h3>Early Sketches</h3>
<p>
	Since we have only started working on this project for 2 weeks we are still in the early planning stages. I have a few concepts for the data visualization and the interactivity in the website. One is that the data will be represented on a map with information about the city displayed on the left once you select the city.

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
	I’ve looked at other visualizations made with D3 as well as other ways of displaying data from cities. I’ve also considered what other companies have made in this space. <a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/03/18822/how-does-your-state-rank-integrity">The Center for Public Integrity</a> has a visualization of state integrity rankings  and the <a href="http://democracy.foundationcenter.org/">Foundation Center</a> has a data platform that shows data on democracy and sources of funding in the US.</p>
	<p>
From the Center for Public Integrity I liked that they had a different coloring system related to the grades that they gave certain states. The scale of colors helped to communicate visually the health of the state’s transparency without having the detailed data explanations. What I liked about the Foundation Center was the ability to export to CSV that would increase the accessibility to the data that we collect.

<h3>Final Product</>
	<p>I created the final website with a home page, about, methodology, and visualization. I added on to the inital prototypes and color schemes.</p>
	<p>The visualizations were done with a plug in Datawrapper that allows easy download for csv.</p>
