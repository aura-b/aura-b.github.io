<a id="hello" class="anchor" href="#hello" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>👋 Hi there! I'm Aura 👩🏽‍💻<br> A UX Researcher from the Bay Area making digital products for impact and inclusion. </h1>
        <p> Since being introduced to technology in high school I have been passionate about tech inclusion and I’ve volunteered at nonprofits such as Dev/Mission, Girls Who Code, Technolochicas, NCWIT, and Black Girls Code. I studied design, computer science, and social science at UC Berkeley writing my thesis on design and technology for urban equity.
<br>Through my experience working in the tech industry, I found a calling in UX research where I work to uncover meaningful, impactful, and empowering solutions and thoughtfully bring in the voices of the people who it will impact. In my free time I like to try new recipes, take photos, and add to my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/aurabooo?si=aa676cb2954b4fec">Spotify playlists.</a></p>
